# Ludo Game 

This is a console-based Ludo game developed in Python as part of a university project for the **Intelligent Search Algorithms** course.
The game features AI opponents powered by the **Expectiminimax algorithm**, showcasing the application of intelligent search techniques in game decision-making.

## Project Context
- **Course**: Intelligent Search Algorithms
- **Year/Semester**: Fourth Year, First Semester
- **Objective**: Implement and demonstrate the use of the Expectiminimax algorithm in a game with chance elements (dice rolls) and adversarial decision-making.

## Features
- **AI Opponents**: The computer players use the **Expectiminimax algorithm** to make strategic decisions.
- **Multiplayer Modes**:
  - **Human vs Computer**: Play against AI opponents.
  - **4 Computers**: Watch 4 AI players compete against each other.
- **Console-Based Interface**: A simple and interactive text-based interface for gameplay.
- **Customizable Rules**: Adjust game rules.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Algorithm**: Expectiminimax for AI decision-making.
